# Shaders

Shaders are (a set of) instructions that are executed all at once for every single pixel on the screen. That means that the code you write, behaves differently depending on the position of the pixel on the screen. (Visit [https://thebookofshaders.com/01/](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/) for more general information on shaders.)

In Lightning, shaders are used to manipulate existing textures. For example, to add rounded corners or change the perspective. You can also use shaders to dither, invert, gray scale or pixelate textures.

> See the documentation on the [Strike Benchmarking Tool](../../G_Tools/Strike/index.md) to read about and experiment with the different types of shaders that Lightning provides.
